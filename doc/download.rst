Downloading Mutalyzer
=====================

The Mutalyzer2 source code is `hosted on GitHub
<https://github.com/mutalyzer/mutalyzer2>`_. The recommended way to get the
Mutalyzer source code is by cloning the `Git`_ repository::

    git clone https://github.com/mutalyzer/mutalyzer2.git

This will give you the current development version. See below for working with
other versions.


Release versions
----------------

All Mutalyzer releases are tagged. You can run ``git tag`` to list the
available tags. Use ``git checkout <tag>`` to switch to a certain release. For
example, to swith to the `2.0.0` release::

    git checkout v2.0.0

Alternatively, you can checkout the `release` branch. This branch always
points to the latest Mutalyzer release.

code directly as a zip archive or tarball. The current development version can
