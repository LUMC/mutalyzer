Issues
======

For historical reasons, we currently have two issue trackers:

1. `Mutalyzer Trac -- Active tickets
   <https://humgenprojects.lumc.nl/trac/mutalyzer/report/2>`_
2. `Mutalyzer GitHub -- Issues
   <https://github.com/mutalyzer/mutalyzer/issues>`_

The first, on the Mutalyzer Trac website, is the advertised location for end
users to report issues. This is also where most feature requests are tracked.

The second, on the Mutalyzer GitHub project site, is mainly for
developers. Most issues here are of infrastructural or technical nature.

In addition to these issue lists, smaller and more specific notes can be found
by grepping the source code for ``Todo``.
